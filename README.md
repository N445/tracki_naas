# Tracki Naas

Tracki Naas is a Python application designed to control and visualize camera positions using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and Matplotlib. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for setting camera positions via a game controller or manual inputs.

## Features

- **Camera Control**: Set the position of a camera using a game controller or manual inputs.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the camera's position and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) using Matplotlib for better insights.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive user experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (if running from source)
- Matplotlib (if running from source)
- Tkinter (if running from source)

## Installation

### Using the Executable (Recommended)

1. **Download the Executable**:

   Download the pre-built executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/N445/tracki_naas/releases).

3. **Run the Executable**:

   Simply double-click the downloaded `.exe` file to launch the application.

### Running from Source

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```sh

```

3. **Run the Application**:

Navigate to the project directory and run the main script:

```sh
python tracki_naas_v2py.py
```

## Usage

1. **Set Camera Position**: Use the game controller or manual inputs to set the camera's position (x, y, z) and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw).
2. **Visualize Data**: Click the visualize button to see the camera's position and orientation plotted on a graph.
3. **Save Data**: Save your data for future use.
